File explaining what kind of sort is used, what the sort can do, where the sort code came from, and how many milliseconds it took to sort the numbers.

 
 As insertion sort is already used to sort the numbers, I have decided to use bubble sort and the selection sort.
 
 Bubble Sort:
 
 Bubble sort compares pairs of numbers that are next to each other in a group of unsorted numbers until the numbers are sorted from the smallest to the largest. 
 
 The bubble sort code for C programming can be found at http://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/source-code/c-program-bubble-sort. 
 
 The time that it took to sort the numbers is 84215 milliseconds.
 
 
 Selection Sort:
 
 Selection sort sorts a group of numbers by finding the smallest number first and then finding the second smallest number and so on until the numbers are sorted from smallest to largest.
 
 The code for selection sort can be found at http://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/source-code/c-program-selection-sort.
 
 The time that it took to sort the numbers is 32465 milliseconds.
